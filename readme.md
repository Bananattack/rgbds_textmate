==============

Some syntax highlighting rules for coding in Z80 assembly as a Textmate language plugin.
It should work in **Sublime Text 2**, or in other editors that support Textmate plugins.
The syntax is particularly designed for [RGBDS](http://www.otakunozoku.com/rednex-gameboy-development-system/) and Gameboy-specific directives.

![Preview of the syntax rules is here:](https://github.com/Bananattack/rgbds_textmate/raw/master/syntax_preview.png)

To install for Sublime Text 2 on Windows, copy the **"Z80 Assembly"** folder to here:

    %APPDATA%\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages

Enjoy!
