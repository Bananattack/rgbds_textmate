rgbds_textmate
==============

Some incomplete syntax highlighting rules for coding in Z80 assembly as a Textmate language plugin.
It should work in Sublime Text 2, or in other editors that support Textmate plugins.
The syntax is particularly designed for [RGBDS](http://www.otakunozoku.com/rednex-gameboy-development-system/) and Gameboy-specific directives.

To install for Sublime Text 2 on Windows, copy the `Z80 Assembly` folder to your `%APPDATA%\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages`.

Enjoy!
