rgbds_textmate
--------------

Some incomplete syntax highlighting rules for coding in Z80 assembly as a Textmate language plugin.
It should work in Sublime Text 2, or in other editors that support Textmate plugins.
The syntax is particularly designed for [RGBDS](http://www.otakunozoku.com/rednex-gameboy-development-system/) and Gameboy-specific directives.

Enjoy!
